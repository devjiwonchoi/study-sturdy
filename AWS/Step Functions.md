AWS Step Functions is a serverless function orchestrator that makes it easy to sequence AWS Lambda functions and multiple AWS services into business-critical applications. Through its visual interface, you can create and run a series of checkpointed and event-driven workflows that maintain the application state. The output of one step acts as an input to the next. Each step in your application executes in order, as defined by your business logic.

AWS Step Functions enables you to implement a business process as a series of steps that make up a workflow. The individual steps in the workflow can invoke a Lambda function or a container that has some business logic, update a database such as DynamoDB or publish a message to a queue once that step or the entire workflow completes execution.

Benefits of Step Functions:

Build and update apps quickly: AWS Step Functions lets you build visual workflows that enable the fast translation of business requirements into technical requirements. You can build applications in a matter of minutes, and when needs change, you can swap or reorganize components without customizing any code.

Improve resiliency: AWS Step Functions manages state, checkpoints and restarts for you to make sure that your application executes in order and as expected. Built-in try/catch, retry and rollback capabilities deal with errors and exceptions automatically.

Write less code: AWS Step Functions manages the logic of your application for you and implements basic primitives such as branching, parallel execution, and timeouts. This removes extra code that may be repeated in your microservices and functions.
